## Setup
There are two ways to set up the development environment: using Docker or setting it up locally.
### 1️⃣ Docker

You can simply set it up using `Docker`, this is the simpler option.  
- First, install Docker from https://www.docker.com/.
- Download Docker Desktop based on your operating system.
- Once installed, run the following two commands to start the service.
  
```bash
   docker build -t dti5125-dialogflow-fastapi-webhook .
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 dti5125-dialogflow-fastapi-webhook
```
This will start the FastAPI server at: http://localhost:8080.  
That’s it — you’re all set!

To stop Docker, run:
```bash
  # Check the running containers and find the container ID
  docker ps
  # Stop the container using its ID
  docker stop <container_id>
```

### 2️⃣ Local env
#### Enable virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
#### Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you add or update any packages, execute the following command to freeze the versions:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
#### Run service
```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
This will start the FastAPI server at: http://localhost:8000.

You can open the interactive API docs at: http://localhost:8000/docs

## API Testing
### Postman
Postman is a tool that lets you easily send requests to your APIs and inspect the responses — perfect for testing endpoints during development.  
You can download it here: https://www.postman.com/  

Here’s a sample request that Dialogflow sends to the webhook. You can copy the code below and import it into your Postman.
- To import: open Postman Desktop, go to File → Import, then paste the cURL code — and you're good to go.
- You can replace https://fastapi-service-945640963381.us-central1.run.app/ with your local address, such as http://localhost:8080 or http://localhost:8000.
- You can also modify fields like `queryText`, `intent`, `outputContexts`, and `parameters` based on the specific Dialogflow request you want to simulate.
Feel free to adjust the port number based on your local setup.
```curl
curl --location 'https://fastapi-service-945640963381.us-central1.run.app/webhook' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "queryResult": {
    "queryText": "yes",
    "parameters": {},
    "outputContexts": [
      {
        "name": "projects/dti-5125-chatbot-464822/agent/sessions/a3392205-3a1e-45ab-176b-08f8df34cd13/contexts/report_body_reactions_and_pain_issue-followup",
        "lifespanCount": 1,
        "parameters": {
          "symptom": "pain",
          "symptom.original": "pain"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "projects/dti-5125-chatbot-464822/agent/sessions/a3392205-3a1e-45ab-176b-08f8df34cd13/contexts/__system_counters__",
        "parameters": {
          "no-input": 0,
          "no-match": 0
        }
      }
    ],
    "intent": {
      "name": "projects/dti-5125-chatbot-464822/agent/intents/a3d0200f-473e-455d-be09-2de3688e317f",
      "displayName": "Report_Body_Reactions_And_Pain_Issue - yes"
    }
  }
}'
```

## Integration Testing
### 1️⃣ Local Testing with Ngrok
Since local services (like `http://localhost:8000`) can’t be accessed from the internet, we need a tool to generate a temporary public link for them — that’s why we use `ngrok`.
1. Install `ngrok`, download from: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Connect your account:
    ```
    ngrok config add-authtoken <your ngrok token>
    ```
   You can find your auth token here: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup

3. Start `ngrok`:  
   Run the following command to expose your local FastAPI service:  
    ```
    ngrok http 8000
    ```
   _**Note**_: If you're using Docker, make sure to change the port number to 8080, or another port that suits your setup.  
    If successful, you'll see something like:
    ```
    Forwarding  https://ab12cd34.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
    ```
    Add your endpoint to the URL, for example: https://ab12cd34.ngrok.io/webhook  
   Copy and paste it into your Dialogflow Webhook URL field, make sure to click Save after updating.

### 2️⃣ Testing via Public Deployment (Render / Google Cloud Run)
This project is currently configured to support automated deployments to two platforms for demonstration purposes and public access:
1. **_Render_** is a cloud platform that offers simple, zero‑configuration deployment for web services and APIs. In this project, deployment to Render is automatically triggered whenever commits are pushed to the `main` branch.  
   _Webhook URL_: https://dti5125-dialogflow-fastapi-webhook.onrender.com/webhook
2. **_Google Cloud Run_** is a fully managed serverless platform that automatically scales containerized applications in response to HTTP requests.  A GitHub Actions workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which automatically deploys to Google Cloud Run on every push to the `main` branch.  
   _Webhook URL_: https://fastapi-service-945640963381.us-central1.run.app/webhook
